    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Ontogeny is the development of an organism from egg fertilization to its mature state. It is driven by expression of different genes at each stage of development, associated with phenotypic changes. There is a lot of discussion on how these sets of genes differ between species. The earliest studies of embryogenesis, performed by Karl Ernst Ritter von Baer in the 19th century, suggested that the most similar state of development between related species, also known as the phylotypic stage, happens at the earliest stages of embryogenesis. This lead to what is called the funnel model, proposing that related species are very similar at the onset of embryogenesis and diverge as they develop. However, more recent work has shown that this convergence happens later, earliest stages being more different between species, this gave rise to the hourglass model. Both the funnel and hourglass model were based on morphological observations, but it is now possible to test these models by combining gene expression data at different stages of embryogenesis with phylogenetic information for the concerned genes to better study the similarity between species. Here, I investigate a study relying on an approach termed phylostratigraphy, which consists in tracing the origin of specific genes through similarity searches. This allows to build a phylogenetic tree where each gene has a rank that estimates their age. These ranks can be used to get a metric of age for the whole transcriptome at each developmental stage, called Transcriptome Age Index (TAI). Results obtained in this study support the hourglass model, focusing on expression datasets from the zebrafish _Danio rerio_, Drosophilia, the mosquito _Anopheles_ and the nematode _Caenorhabditis elegans_. In this report, I use forensic bioinformatics to repeat the analysis from [Domazet-Lošo et Tautz, 2010](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7325/full/nature09632.html) in zebrafish to have a critical view of each step and a better understanding of their results. Finally, I propose improvements for the analysis, explaining how it would affect the results."

    "## Methods\n",

    "I reproduced the analysis from the paper using python 2 with the modules panda, numpy, matplotlib and GEOparse. I used expression data from _Danio rerio_ (zebrafish) to reproduce the results shown in figure 1a of the paper. Expression data for zebrafish was made available by the authors and phylostrata dataset were obtained from the University of Lausanne Computational Biology Group website. The first step was to load the expression data from microarray experiments and extract meaningful informations for each sample (developmental stage, age and sex). The expression data was then formatted and annotated with microarray spot ID using the GEO platform (GPL) annotation file. Throughout the whole report, \"expression\" refers to the microarray signal intensity value and therefore has no unit."

On the figure presented in this report, the vertical lines represent the earliest time stamp at which a developmental stage was observed.

    "As depicted above, log-transforming the expression dramatically changes the results, showing these outliers genes had a strong impact on the TAI value. The lowest TAI are now at the very begining of development and the transcriptome becomes younger with time. This would be in accordance with the funnel model, proposing that the phylotypic stage is at the very beginning of ontogeny."

    "This analysis shows the impact normalization and processing steps can have on the results. In this particular case, it is interesting because the original study supports the hourglass model, while the same analysis with normalized data supports the funnel model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating TAI without log-transforming yields a biased estimation of transcriptome age as it will be dominated by outlier genes. Therefore, the original results would suggest that strongly expressed genes follow the hourglass model, which is also interesting, however this does not apply when giving more weight to lowly expressed genes."
